# Journey Builder
## Custom Activities

A Journey Builder Custom Activity allows the marketer to interact with data that lives outside of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC).  It allows you to post a payload to an external endpoint for further processing or to retrieve external data then return the result of that process or data back into the journey builder interaction using Data Binding.

In a nutshell, to build, publish and use a Journey Builder Custom Activity you need to:

* Define an App and Journey Builder Activity in the App Center
* Build you Activity (Node.js sample provided)
* Push your Activity to Heroku (or other hosting platform that has SSL endpoint)
* Add the Activity to your Journey Builder interaction
